Cheak Romlek (ចែករំលែក) - Your Organized Content Hub

Cheak Romlek is a mobile application designed to help users efficiently save, organize, and quickly retrieve links and content they find online, categorized for easy access. It acts as a personalized, clutter-free digital notebook for everything you want to remember and revisit later, moving beyond simple browser bookmarks or cluttered note apps.

Problem Statement

Users frequently encounter interesting links, articles, recipes, videos, or shops online but rely on disorganized methods like saving them to browser bookmarks, sending them in chat apps, or pasting them into simple note applications. As the saved content grows, it becomes disorganized, difficult to search, and nearly impossible to categorize properly, leading to information overload and forgotten links. There is a need for a dedicated, localized mobile application that focuses on structured content saving and easy retrieval by category.

Usage

⦁	Launch the app and proceed past the splash screen.
⦁	Log in or create a new account to access your personal content library.
⦁	View and filter your saved links based on different categories (Restaurants, Videos, Articles, etc.).
⦁	Add new content by pasting a link and providing a title, category, and optional notes.
⦁	Quickly manage saved content with actions like editing or deleting the link.
⦁	Manage your profile and access app settings (theme, language, etc.).
⦁	Log out when finished.
